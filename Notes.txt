Notes

The pygame module is not compatible with Python 3.8 and higher, have to use 3.7 unfortunately.


TODOs:
- meal should generate only positions outside the current snake. Just re-roll many times should be ok.
- re-draw only if something changed since last draw
- call Auto-mover checks only if the snake moved, not every frame

Auto-Mover TODOs:
- check for suicide moves
- create random non-suicide move
- the same with bias: towards nearest wall, then follow the wall? away from areas with many occupied spaces?
- systematic fall-back strategy: Run towards a wall, follow the wall. If LC or CL becomes available, use that.


Open Questions:
- should the snake accept horizontal input if already moving horizontally? Same for vertically?
